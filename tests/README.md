To run the tests you require a file named `token.json` with the following data

```json
{
   "key": "KEY HERE",
   "keyType": "Bearer or Wolke" // This can be optional
}
```
After that run by a simple `node tests/<TEST_NAME>` (or `node <TEST_NAME>` if you're running in this directory).  
It's that simple.

Testing? I'm done.  
Hotel? Trivago.
